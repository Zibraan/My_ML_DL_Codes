The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic neural networks to advanced frameworks and architectures.  One of the highlights was the transformer architecture, which was covered in remarkable depth with absolute clarity—no confusion, just a seamless understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and how these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.  This course is truly for everyone, whether you’re getting started or deepening your expertise in Generative AI. Highly recommended! Kudos to Keerthi and Amit for their incredible efforts in designing and delivering this course so beautifully, and for the vast amount of knowledge they have gathered and shared with us!Read moreAshish UpretiLead SDEIntelI really enjoyed the GenAI course. Coming from someone with zero knowledge on the topic, after seven weeks, I'm able to understand the magic behind GenAI. I also liked the quality of the content and how you broke down such a complex topic for easy understanding. I appreciate your patience and eagerness to clarify all the doubts. I have already enrolled in the LLD and HLD courses and am looking forward to it.Read moreSathish KrishnaBusiness Enterprise ArchitectIBMGenerative AI has been so much helpful for me in my job and my research, that this course has given me a breadth and depth of the fundamentals of every topic that we have been hearing in the trends of Computing Domain. Keerti has thought this course in a wonderful way that I can slice and dice the complexity to understand the reasoning behind each concept. I recommend this course to everyone. Kudos to Keerti and her entire team.Read moreRaman SharmaPrincipal Software EngineerOracleI found the course very helpful and well structured. It started with the very basics of neural networks, it even touched upon the maths to get a proper understanding of what's going on under the hood. Gradually progressing towards more advanced models like CNN, RNN, and then transformers was done in a steady and helpful way. The intuitions Keerti provided were very useful and make a lasting impression in your mind regarding the topic. I haven't found such intuitions and easy to understand explanations elsewhere. Taking this course has increased my confidence towards GenAI and it has given me a solid platform from where I can read more AI related blogs, whitepapers, etc. without feeling overwhelmed. It has even helped me demonstrate a POC within my team that was well received. I recommend this course to anyone starting out with GenAIRead moreSudarshan Suresh SrikantSoftware EngineerCienaKudos to the Educosys team and thanks to Keerti for making learning AI/ML easy. Starting from the basics upto advanced level with most up to date AI developments, the course instilled me with great confidence in approaching problems that could be solved with AI. Every minute detail with code was covered in-depth. I would definitely recommend taking up this course.Read moreSyed IInformation Security OfficerForm3A real game changer of a course especially when it comes to real world applications.

Coming from someone with zero knowledge on the topic, after seven weeks, I'm able to understand the magic behind GenAI. I also liked the quality of the content and how you broke down such a complex topic for easy understanding. I appreciate your patience and eagerness to clarify all the doubts.

Kudos to Keerti and her entire team.Read moreRaman SharmaPrincipal Software EngineerOracleI found the course very helpful and well structured. It started with the very basics of neural networks, it even touched upon the maths to get a proper understanding of what's going on under the hood. Gradually progressing towards more advanced models like CNN, RNN, and then transformers was done in a steady and helpful way. The intuitions Keerti provided were very useful and make a lasting impression in your mind regarding the topic. I haven't found such intuitions and easy to understand explanations elsewhere. Taking this course has increased my confidence towards GenAI and it has given me a solid platform from where I can read more AI related\", 'such intuitions and easy to understand explanations elsewhere. Taking this course has increased my confidence towards GenAI and it has given me a solid platform from where I can read more AI related blogs, whitepapers, etc. without feeling overwhelmed.
